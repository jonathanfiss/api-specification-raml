  <h3 align="center">API Specification RAML</h3>

  <p align="center">A template with reusable fragments to boost your projects!</p> 
</div>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The **API Specification RAML** project serves as a guide to demonstrate the utilization of key RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) fragments, including the **[Common Fragment][common-fragment]**, **[Securities Fragment][securities-fragment]**, and **[Domain Fragment][domain-fragment]**. Its purpose is to showcase how these fragments can be effectively integrated to streamline the development of RAML specifications.

## Project Contents

This project encompasses the basic structure of a RAML specification along with practical examples showcasing the utilization and importation of the aforementioned fragments:

### RAML Structure

The project provides a standard RAML specification structure, outlining the key components required for a well-defined API specification.

### Fragment Integration Examples

1. **Common Fragment Integration**:
   - Demonstrates how to integrate the **Common Fragment** to leverage reusable structures, error handling, and common headers across API layers.

2. **Securities Fragment Integration**:
   - Illustrates the incorporation of the **Securities Fragment**, showcasing the utilization of predefined security schemas and custom security measures.

3. **Domain Fragment Integration**:
   - Highlights the integration of the **Domain Fragment**, exhibiting the use of predefined data types and examples tailored to the business domain.

### Example Usage

The project provides clear examples of how to use and import these fragments within your own RAML specifications, promoting code reusability and consistency.


The **API Specification RAML** project serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to leverage common, secure, and domain-specific fragments in their RAML specifications, ultimately fostering a more efficient and consistent approach to API development.

<!--## Usage Instructions

1. Create a new RAML API Specification project in Design Centre named: "Common RAML Fragments"
2. Add all the contents of this repository into a ZIP excluding the license and readme.md file.
3. Go to your Design Centre Project and choose "Import", then select the ZIP.
4. Ensure you set the root RAML as the one which has been imported.
5. Publish this asset to Exchange.
7. This asset can now be imported into any new API Specification Design Centre project.
